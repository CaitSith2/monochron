Loading the firmware.
Please be advised that this program stores values in EEPROM memory,
As such, EEPROM must be loaded with each new version.
Please use or examine the attached loadfw.bat or loadfw.sh (assumes use of a tinyusb programmer)
Failure to load the EEPROM will result in a blank screen and continuous beeps.
This may be corrected by loaded loading the EEPROM.

-->KNOWN ISSUE: TimeZone Adjust is just that, Adjust for your TimeZone, please account for Daylight Savings Time,
The GPS Module Currently does not do that.  You must account for this in your adjust.  
IE: If you're in Nevada, your TimeZone adjust is GMT -8.  Subtract 1 for Daylight Savings Time: -7.
When Daylight Savings Time ends, Adjust back to -8.
